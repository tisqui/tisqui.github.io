Initially I planned to visit Carrara town site, but the ruins I found were not the town itself - it was built later concrete plant. Carrara had a unique difference from mining town I visited before - it had no golden or silver mine, as the whole focus was on marble quarry that they had there. 

The township was officially dedicated in May of 1913. The town a post office(remained operational till 1924), a hotel, a restaurant, a store, a town swimming pool, and a Tonopah & Tidewater railroad station. The population consisted of about 100 residences.

Only foundations remain in the townsite now and you have to be careful not to miss the turn tot he dirty road from 95.

Here is the map with the remains sights:

<h2>Elizalde Cement Plant</h2>

Philipine financed Elizalde Cement Company built a cement plant near Carrara in 1930th (early 1940th?). Unfortunately, plant was never functioning - there are a lot of versions online, from the WWII Phillipino issues to the high labor/transportation cost in that area and also inability to cope with the results of the massive fire. Why they built plant there, in this remote area with no huge construction sites nearby? Now this area looks completely empty, but back then there was a Carrara town couple of miles to the south with marble quarry, so transportation logistics was probably in place. May be they also planned to use marble in the cement production (I know almost nothing about cement).

As of early 2018 you can see several big remains of the plant constructions and buildings. No roofs left. Unfortunately, some of the ruins have graffiti on them. I liked some of them, but I would feel much better if they were not there. It ruins the atmosphere a bit.
