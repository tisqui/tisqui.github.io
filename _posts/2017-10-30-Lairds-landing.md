![Lairds Landing][lairds1]
This was one of my favorite trips to the unincorporated community. This place is located on the National Parks land and open to public, but secluded enough to keep people from visiting it. 

You have to drive several miles on the dirt road and have a 1 mile hike from the road ending to the actual place.
Most of the places I visited before were abandoned long time ago. This place is uninhabited since 1995, when [Clayton Lewis](http://www.claytonlewis.net/index.html) died.

<h2>Lairds Landing history</h2>

The history of Lairds Landing in Tomales Bay began long time before Lewis settled there. Miwok settlements were in that area for more than 2000 years before the Europeans arrived. Miwok families continued to live in Lairds Landing till the last were evicted in 1955. Mr Lewis transformed this place in a real bohemian enclave, respecting the remains of the old Miwok shades.

<i>How the place looked before 1955 eviction</i>

"Point Reyes National Seashore was 2 years old, just establishing its boundaries. Laird's was privately owned. Lewis contacted the owner. They struck a deal: rent for free and $5 an hour for repairs. Lewis, Judy Perlman and her 1-year-old son settled in.

Lewis stabilized foundations, fixed the roof and rolled out linoleum. He added flourishes — corbels, flower boxes, and for the guest cottage, an elaborate bed and eventually a two-story tower — all from wood scavenged at local dumps.

Propane heated the spring water and kept the stove and refrigerator running. Oil lamps brought a glow to the night.

The park service acquired the property in 1972 and tried to get him to leave, but the Point Reyes community rallied to his support. He was given a new lease, starting at $75 a month" (1)

While we were exploring the place we noticed a lot of signs someone is clearing and trying to restore the place. There were a lot of black bags with trash near one of the buildings and the main building has sings of the repairs to be done - fresh wooden deck and roof. Hope this place will be restored, not just demolished and forgotten.

This bedroom still looks amazing:
