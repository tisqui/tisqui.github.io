![Gold Hill][gold_hill1]
On your way to Virginia city you would pass a small town - Gold Hill. This place is worth a visit.

This mining camp got its start at about the same time as Virginia City in the late 1850s, when both silver and gold were found in the area. Initially, the camp was little more than a few miners living in tents and crude shacks. However, by the early 1860s it rivaled Virginia City in size and population. The town was incorporated in December, 1862 in order to prevent its annexation by Virginia City. (1)

Prosperity was sustained for a period of 20 years between 1868 and 1888 by mining the Comstock Lode, a major deposit of gold and silver ore. Mines such as the Yellow Jacket, Crown Point, and Belcher brought in over $10 million each in dividends. The Gold Hill post office remained in operation until 1943. Today Gold Hill exists as a shell of its former self; its population in 2005 was 191.
