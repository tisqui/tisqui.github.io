# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

  Hi! I am keen on the local history and for the last several years
  explore ghost towns in California. Posted my photos in Facebook,
  but I feel like I need to have a blog where I can share not only the photos, 
  but the history of the towns.
